# Create a Ubuntu Linux VM with Apache, MySQL, and PHP installed.

This template will provide a new client with a complete LAMP stack deployment into Azure on an Ubuntu virtual machine.

This master config consists of the following resources:
- a new Azure Virtual Network
- a new storage account
- an Ubuntu Linux instance with Apache, MySQL, and PHP installed.

Once deployed, a simple default PHP script is created.  Go to /phpinfo.php to see the page and verify installation.
