# This code must be run on a Server 2012 or higher domain controller

# specify gateway machine  where Project Honolulu is installed
$gateway = "SOV-ADConnect"

# specify the node you wish to authenticate against when accessing Project Honolulu - in most cases, it's the primary domain controller
$node = "SOV-PDC"

# Collect the gateway computer object
$gatewayObject = Get-ADComputer -Identity $gateway

# Collect the authentication node computer object
$nodeObject = Get-ADComputer -Identity $node

# Configure the authentication node to allow the gateway object to delegate authentication
Set-ADComputer -Identity $nodeObject -PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount $gatewayObject
