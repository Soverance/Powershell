# This script will iterate through the active directory groups, and apply an auditing rule to record all actions made to the groups by Domain Admins.

# While many actions will be recorded in the event viewer, we are specifically looking for modifications made to AD Groups
# Security Event 4728 = User Added to Group
# Security Event 4729 = User Removed from Group

# Import The Required Module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

#Get The RootDSE Info
$rootDSE = Get-ADRootDSE

# Create a Hash Table With The LDAPDisplayName And schemaIDGUID Of Each Schema Class And Attribute
$mappingTable_LDAPDisplayName_schemaIDGUID = @{}

    -LDAPFilter "(schemaIDGUID=*)" `
    -Properties LDAPDisplayName,schemaIDGUID | ForEach-Object{
        $mappingTable_LDAPDisplayName_schemaIDGUID[$_.LDAPDisplayName]=[System.GUID]$_.schemaIDGUID
    }

# Get List Of AD Groups to process
# This just gets all groups.  Modify the filter if necessary...
$ADGroups = Get-ADGroup -Server "SOV-PDC" -Filter *
# for example, to get all -H groupds, you might use this:
#$ADGroups = Get-ADGroup -Server "UA-PDC" -Filter {name -like "*-H*"}
# or for testing you might use a specific group, like the dev group
#$ADGroups = Get-ADGroup -Server "UA-PDC" -Identity "Development"
